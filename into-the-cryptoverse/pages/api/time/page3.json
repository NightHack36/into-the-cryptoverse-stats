Frida Kahlo is a constant source of inspiration to me… an artist that, despite constant pain, found a way to push through and achieve an immortality seldom matched. \\n\\nShe did this through something that would be easily recognizable in the current age of Instagram and Tic Toe: the selfie… but unlike that lot, there was nothing vapid about her painfully reflective self-portraits. It was a brutally honest accounting of what she experienced.  But through most of her work, there was always that face. It links and weaves every painting together into a quilt that tells her story. \\nI’m hypnotized by so much of her work. \\n\\nI’ve drawn two portraits of Frida Kahlo… One simply from my memory of what I thought she looked like…and the other… this piece… based on a photo her father took of her. Both of them were created while listening to a song from the band The Minders, called, appropriately, “Frida.” It’s a song that, just like her paintings, is mesmerizing. So I put it on a loop used it as the soundtrack to create this piece. Frida she doesn't care\\nAll of her eyebrows bend on sorrow\\nUntie her straight from that chair\\nGive her a halo give it to FridaI hope this art captures her fierce independence and bravery… for that’s what I feel when I see her photos and her artwork.","attributes":[{"trait_type":"Artist","value":"John Mavroudis"},{"trait_type":"Edition","value":"Single"},{"trait_type":"Border","value":"White"},{"trait_type":"Drop","value":"Inspiration"}]},

This an inheritance that I believe is made up of the sacrifices of Black immigrants, who abandoned or postponed the pursuit of their dreams to ensure the success of future generations. This sacrifice came at such a large price: one that can never be repaid. In reflecting on the price so many generations of Black elders, leaders, and parents have paid, I realized that it is through their sacrifices that I have been able to pursue my own aspirations in life. In painting “The Cost,” I chose to paint myself resting to acknowledge the effort of their labor and how much healing and restoration it brought me. This rest has allowed me to have the time and the energy to imagine a world and space that doesn’t exist yet. The blades of grass I depicted represent the vast number of individuals whose work I am supported by, and whose efforts are my foundation. “The Cost” came out of a desire to see myself as an equal subject of a realistic portrait, and that the focus of my beauty can be captivating enough.\\n\\nI’ve learned it’s expensive to rest and to dream, but they have taught me that I am worth every dime.","attributes":[{"trait_type":"Artist","value":"Destiny Kirumira"},{"trait_type":"Edition","value":"Single"},{"trait_type":"Border","value":"White"},{"trait_type":"Drop","value":"Inspiration"}]},

Defying suffocating conventional pressures, she pursued her dream and took her first lesson in 1921. Given the rickety nature of early planes, this was a courageous path to follow. Eventually she purchased her first bright yellow plane and named it The Canary, which she used to set many records. Ultimately, she became the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic. She followed this as the first woman to fly solo from Honolulu to California. On July 2, 1937, while attempting to become the first woman to circumnavigate the earth, Amelia perished. In her last transmission, after indicating she was short of fuel on the most difficult leg of the journey, Earhart reported, “We are running north and south.” Nothing further was heard from her. Gone too soon, we thank you Amelia for taking to the skies, paving the way for many women to follow.

Frida Kahlo is a constant source of inspiration to me… an artist that, despite constant pain, found a way to push through and achieve an immortality seldom matched. \\n\\nShe did this through something that would be easily recognizable in the current age of Instagram and Tic Toe: the selfie… but unlike that lot, there was nothing vapid about her painfully reflective self-portraits. It was a brutally honest accounting of what she experienced.  But through most of her work, there was always that face. It links and weaves every painting together into a quilt that tells her story. \\nI’m hypnotized by so much of her work. \\n\\nI’ve drawn two portraits of Frida Kahlo… One simply from my memory of what I thought she looked like…and the other… this piece… based on a photo her father took of her. Both of them were created while listening to a song from the band The Minders, called, appropriately, “Frida.” It’s a song that, just like her paintings, is mesmerizing. So I put it on a loop used it as the soundtrack to create this piece. Frida she doesn't care\\nAll of her eyebrows bend on sorrow\\nUntie her straight from that chair\\nGive her a halo give it to FridaI hope this art captures her fierce independence and bravery… for that’s what I feel when I see her photos and her artwork.","attributes":[{"trait_type":"Artist","value":"John Mavroudis"},{"trait_type":"Edition","value":"Single"},{"trait_type":"Border","value":"White"},{"trait_type":"Drop","value":"Inspiration"}]},
