Defying suffocating conventional pressures, she pursued her dream and took her first lesson in 1921. Given the rickety nature of early planes, this was a courageous path to follow.

We all know that it is natural for Penguins to stand on icebergs, but it should not become the norm to see them wading the waters via a bottle. Through the use of art and common imagery this piece is created to evoke thoughts on our current path as a civilization; are we leading ourselves to the point of no return? Ask yourself this, is the world’s current infatuation with plastic that much more important than a world that will someday be consumed within it?","attributes":[{"trait_type":"Artist","value":"Allison Dayka"},{"trait_type":"Edition","value":"Single"},{"trait_type":"Border","value":"White"},{"trait_type":"Drop","value":"Inspiration"}]},

She did this through something that would be easily recognizable in the current age of Instagram and Tic Toe: the selfie… but unlike that lot, there was nothing vapid about her painfully reflective self-portraits.

The message is to allow things and people to grow in order to see their full potential. People have been trained to remove or cut down a being to keep a certain aesthetic of their environment in order not recognizing they are taking away beings that can enrich themselves and their environment. The American Dandelion as seen in this picture has massive health benefits for people but is is constantly removed from peoples lawns to maintain a certain look. Continue to cut down what is natural and your future will not exist. Allow growth and you will prosper.","attributes":[{"trait_type":"Artist","value":"Kendall Chambers"},{"trait_type":"Edition","value":"Single"},{"trait_type":"Border","value":"White"},{"trait_type":"Drop","value":"Inspiration"}]},

We all know that it is natural for Penguins to stand on icebergs, but it should not become the norm to see them wading the waters via a bottle. Through the use of art and common imagery this piece is created to evoke thoughts on our current path as a civilization; are we leading ourselves to the point of no return? Ask yourself this, is the world’s current infatuation with plastic that much more important than a world that will someday be consumed within it?","attributes":[{"trait_type":"Artist","value":"Allison Dayka"},{"trait_type":"Edition","value":"Single"},{"trait_type":"Border","value":"White"},{"trait_type":"Drop","value":"Inspiration"}]},

Frida Kahlo is a constant source of inspiration to me… an artist that, despite constant pain, found a way to push through and achieve an immortality seldom matched. She did this through something that would be easily recognizable in the current age of Instagram and Tic Toe: the selfie… but unlike that lot, there was nothing vapid about her painfully reflective self-portraits. It was a brutally honest accounting of what she experienced.  But through most of her work, there was always that face. It links and weaves every painting together into a quilt that tells her story.  I’m hypnotized by so much of her work. I’ve drawn two portraits of Frida Kahlo… One simply from my memory of what I thought she looked like…and the other… this piece… based on a photo her father took of her. Both of them were created while listening to a song from the band The Minders, called, appropriately, “Frida.” It’s a song that, just like her paintings, is mesmerizing. So I put it on a loop used it as the soundtrack to create this piece.  Frida she doesn't care All of her eyebrows bend on sorrow Untie her straight from that chair Give her a halo give it to  Frida I hope this art captures her fierce independence and bravery… for that’s what I feel when I see her photos and her artwork.","attributes":[{"trait_type":"Artist","value":"John Mavroudis"},{"trait_type":"Edition","value":"Single"},{"trait_type":"Border","value":"White"},{"trait_type":"Drop","value":"Inspiration"}]},
