Surnames are featured on each star. This piece discusses the role of Asian female representation in Western media. The colour yellow is used to resemble the colour of stars, of skin, of self-image. Future Relics is a series of ten paintings that I have created since 2019 using the iconography of Chinese classical art to express the themes of women, femininity and female sensibility in the 21st century. These paintings are created both digitally and physically. Its physical version is rendered in egg shells.","attributes":[{"trait_type":"Artist","value":"Red Hong Yi"},{"trait_type":"Edition","value":"Single"},{"trait_type":"Border","value":"White"},{"trait_type":"Drop","value":"Inspiration"}]},

The message is to allow things and people to grow in order to see their full potential. People have been trained to remove or cut down a being to keep a certain aesthetic of their environment in order not recognizing they are taking away beings that can enrich themselves and their environment. The American Dandelion as seen in this picture has massive health benefits for people but is is constantly removed from peoples lawns to maintain a certain look. Continue to cut down what is natural and your future will not exist. Allow growth and you will prosper.","attributes":[{"trait_type":"Artist","value":"Kendall Chambers"},{"trait_type":"Edition","value":"Single"},{"trait_type":"Border","value":"White"},{"trait_type":"Drop","value":"Inspiration"}]},
